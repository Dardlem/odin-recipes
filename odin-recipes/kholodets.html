                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Kholodets is one of the Ukrainian foods that might be least familiar to Americans. This dish resembles Jell-O — except that its made from meat stock. The broth is so thick and rich in natural gelatin that it turns into jelly when put in a fridge. To achieve this richness and texture, a pig trotter (that’s the foot of the pig) is boiled for hours with garlic and meat, and then chunks of meat and the broth are distributed into bowls and cooled off.</p>
                <p>The meat jelly goes well with grated horseradish, a Ukrainian condiment that tastes a bit like wasabi. Because kholodets takes so long to cook, it’s considered a treat, and because it’s so rich and needs cold to stay jellified, it’s usually reserved for winter festivities.</p>
                <ul>
                    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                    <li>2 lb pork legs, soaked in cold water and refrigerated 3 hours to overnight</li>
                    <li>5-8 large chicken drumsticks (or any meat with the bone in)</li>
                    <li>2 medium onions</li>
                    <li>1 large carrot</li>
                    <li>1 stick of celery</li>
                    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                    <li>5-10 peppercorns</li>
                    <li>2 tsp salt + more to taste</li>
                    <li>Red Horseradish sause/Hren or Russian mustard to serve</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <li>Make sure you soak the pork legs in cold water (we put them in the fridge overnight which is also a good way to thaw them if you want to make it the next day).</li>
                    <li>In a large pot, Add pork legs, and chicken drum sticks. Add enough water to cover all of the meat. Set over high heat, cover and bring to a boil. As soon as it starts boiling, remove from heat and drain off the water.</li>
                    <li>Rinse the meat, refill with fresh water (enough water to cover all of the meat, plus an extra 1/2-inch over the meat); Don’t add too much water or it won’t be “gelatiney” enough later.</li>
                    <li>Cover and bring to a boil again. Reduce heat to a light boil/simmer and set a timer for 5 hours.</li>
                    <li>After cooking for 5 hours, Add 1 large carrot, 2 medium onions (both ends removed), 1 celery stick, 2 bay leaves, 5-8 peppercorns and 2 tsp salt into the pot and continue boiling  on low heat 1 more hour. It should start to look like a nice chicken broth. Now it’s important that you keep the broth (do not discard the broth!) and do not add more water.</li>
                    <li>Remove the drumsticks and carrot from the broth and let them cool. Discard pork legs, onion and bay leaves. Use a fine mesh sieve with 3 bounty paper towels in the colander and filter the broth through the paper towels. You will be left with a clean broth.</li>
                    <li>Peel and press 4 garlic cloves into the broth and do a taste test to see if more salt is needed.</li>
                    <li>Once the meat has cooled, use a fork to separate meat from the bones. Keep the good meat; discard the rest. Thinly slice the carrot. You can make one big holodets in a rectangular pyrex dish or you can make smaller bowls.</li>
                    <li>Start by placing carrots on the bottom and top with some dill if you wish. Next add the meat in an even layer and pour broth over the meat. You need enough broth to cover the meat and add a little extra over the top. Refrigerate 3 hours to overnight or until firm. Serve with red horseradish/hren or Russian mustard. Once it’s set, set the bowl in hot water for a few seconds, then use a slim spatula to release the gelatin from the dish.</li>
