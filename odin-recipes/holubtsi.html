                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>These cabbage rolls, stuffed with meat and rice and cooked in tomato sauce until they turn soft and juicy, are the perfect comfort food. It’s a dish you spend several hours cooking, so this dish is usually prepared in large pots that can last a family for a couple days. A big cabbage is steamed until the leaves turn soggy and are easy to separate, and soft parts of the leaves are then stuffed with rice and ground pork and rolled. Some people like their holubtsi floating in tomato gravy; others serve them with sour cream. Regardless, it usually comes with dill on top.</p>

                    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                    <li>1 head cabbage (about 4 pounds)</li>
                    <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and finely grated</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
                    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups sour cream, divided</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup buckwheat, rinsed twice with boiling water and drained</li>
                    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                    <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 F. Bring a big pot of salted water to a boil. </li>
                    <li>Remove core from cabbage and place in pot. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, or until softened enough to pull off individual leaves. </li>
                    <li>Carefully remove cabbage head from water and allow it to cool until it's easy to handle. Use a paring knife to cut away thick center stem from each leaf, without cutting all the way through. You will need about 18 stemless leaves. </li>
                    <li>Finely chop remaining cabbage and place it at the bottom of a casserole dish or Dutch oven.
                    </li>
                    <li>Drain potatoes in a sieve or cheesecloth, twisting or pressing to remove as much moisture as possible. </li>
                    <li>Transfer to a large bowl and mix in lemon juice so they don't turn brown. Set aside. </li>
                    <li>In a small skillet, sauté chopped onion in butter until tender. </li>
                    <li>Add onion mixture to the potatoes, combining well. </li>
                    <li>Add 1/2 cup of sour cream and rinsed and drained buckwheat to potato mixture, combining thoroughly. Season to taste with salt and pepper. </li>
                    <li>Place about 1/2 cup of filling on each cabbage leaf. Roll once away from you to encase filling. </li>
                    <li>Flip right side of leaf to the middle, then flip left side. You will have something that looks like an envelope. Keep rolling again until you have a neat little roll. </li>
                    <li>Place cabbage rolls on top of chopped cabbage in casserole dish or Dutch oven, seasoning each layer with salt and pepper. </li>
                    <li>Pour remaining 1 cup of sour cream over holubtsi, cover, and place in oven. Bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until the buckwheat filling is tender. </li>
                </ol>
